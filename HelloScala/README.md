# HelloScala
Create at least 3 new classes. 
They should each have a comment explaining what the class represents. 

In your main() make sure you can instantiate the class and set all of its fields, then print to the console each class with its fields. Use the s"" formatting method.  

Try to make some of your fields arrays and functions.
